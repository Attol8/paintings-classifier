# Painting CLassifier
This project is a part of the [Data Science Art project](insert link) at [Insert Link](http://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org).  Other DSWG projects can be found at [my github page](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg).

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to train a painting classifier that correctly labels paintings' artist, genre and style. The datatset used is public and can be found at [wiki-art Github](https://github.com/cs-chan/ArtGAN/tree/master/WikiArt%20Dataset). The classifier can have multiple real-life use cases like such as forgery detection, objects retrieval in fine-art paintings, and archiving and retrieving artworks.
